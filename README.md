DURATION : 8 WEEKS

MENTOR : NEELA SANTOSH

# DESCRIPTION
This project is to build a Recommendation System that suggests movies/items to users based on their past preferences and the preferences of similar users. The system uses Collaborative Filtering and Matrix Factorization (SVD) to predict user ratings and make personalized recommendations.
# Tools and Technologies:
Language: Python
Libraries Used:
pandas – Data manipulation
numpy – Numerical operations
surprise – A specialized library for building recommender systems
tabulate – (Optional) Pretty print tables of recommended items
Environment: Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

# Approach:
 1. Collaborative Filtering:
Based on the idea that similar users like similar items

Does not require content/features of items or users

 2. Matrix Factorization (SVD):
Reduces high-dimensional user-item matrix into two lower-dimensional matrices

Captures latent factors for users and items

Generalizes well for unseen data
